# Query-Driven Data-Agnostic Data Partitioning

## Background:

‚Ä¢ Physical layout of data is essential in ensuring range query efficiency in disk storage

‚Ä¢ Data that answer the same query can be collocated to minimize unnecessary accesses

‚Ä¢ With one-dimensional (1-D) integer data, reading & sorting data accomplishes this

‚Ä¢ Data is often not integer-based and can be multi-dimensional.

‚Ä¢ When query access patterns are unpredictable and reading physical data is either not possible or too costly, finding strong data layouts becomes an interesting problem

‚Ä¢ Data Mining algorithms, specifically clustering, allow us to develop a possible solution

*Comparison of contiguous and non-contiguous access*

## Approach:

‚Ä¢ Use query responses and workload access patterns to simplify complex data and form representations of original data

*Creating what is called the Characteristic Matrix, a binary matrix representing query access patterns across a workload*

‚Ä¢ A column consists of an object‚Äôs responses to the whole query workload and signifies common access patterns

‚Ä¢ Use columns as coordinate points to represent original data and conduct clustering with Kmeans algorithm (Euclidean distance)

*Representation of K-means iteration*

‚Ä¢ According to the resulting clusters, the Characteristic Matrix is rearranged, placing clustered columns together

‚Ä¢ Error metric evaluates clustering effectiveness

*Error function calculating effectiveness of clustering where k is the first occurrence of a 1 in the current row, n is the last
occurrence, and ùëÄ sub ùëê is the characteristic matrix. The metric is a physical representation of unnecessary page accesses.*
